  Controls various things about the node, like its duration, and how it is attached to the parent node.
properties:
  duration:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: -1
    argument: Constant0
    time: invIfPositive
    desc: |
      The node duration in seconds. Can be set to -1 to make the node last forever.
  delay:
    field: float
    time: inv
    desc: |
      The delay in seconds before the node becomes active.
  unk_ds3_f1_1:
    field: int
    default: 1
  attachment:
    type: AttachMode
    field: int
    enum: AttachMode
    default: AttachMode.Parent
    desc: |
      Controls how the node is attached to the parent node.
  depthBias:
    field: float
    desc: |
      Controls the rendering order of this node. Lower values will cause the node to be drawn in front of nodes with a higher value. This only affects the node with this action, it is not inherited by descendant nodes.

      This does not affect the actual depth of the node in the scene. It will still draw behind other objects even with a big negative bias. It only affects the order it is rendered in relative to other effects.

      Model particles and light sources are not affected by this in any way. Most, if not all, other types of appearances are affected by it, even GPU particles and lens flares.
