      Controls how fast time passes for the entire effect.
  limitViewDistance:
    field: bool
    default: false
    desc: |
      When enabled, this limits visibility of nodes outside of the distance defined by {@link maxViewDistance}.
  maxViewDistance:
    field: float
    scale: distance
    desc: |
      All nodes that are farther away from the camera than this will not be visible. This restriction requires {@link limitViewDistance} to be enabled.

      The game will simulate playing the effect for this amount of time in seconds before actually displaying the effect. This does not mean that it will delay displaying the effect, just that the effect will start as if it had already been playing for this time, kind of like skipping ahead in the animation. This doesn't affect everything in the effect, and a list of things affected has not been made, but it does affect periodic emitters at least.

      Setting this to very high values can cause noticeable stutters in the game when the effect is spawned due to it having to simulate playing the effect for so long.

      In Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, and Elden Ring, this value will be rounded to the nearest 1/30s due to how it is stored in the file format. It is stored differently in Armored Core 6, and so no rounding will happen for that.
