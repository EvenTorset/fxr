  Simulates an interaction with water, allowing effects to create ripples in nearby water. The interaction basically pushes water in a shape controlled by a texture down to a given depth and holds it there for a duration before releasing it.
properties:
  texture:
    field: int
    default: 50004
    resource: texture
    textureType: d
    desc: |
      The ID for a texture that controls the shape of the interaction.
  depth:
    field: float
    default: 1
    scale: instanceSize
    desc: |
      Controls how deep to push the water, or how intense the ripples caused by the interaction are.
  size:
    field: float
    default: 1
    scale: instanceSize
    desc: |
      Controls the size of the interaction area. Ripples caused by the interaction may go outside of the area.
  descent:
    field: float
    default: 0.15
    time: inv
    desc: |
      The time it takes for the water to be pushed down to the {@link depth} in seconds.
  duration:
    field: float
    default: 0.15
    time: inv
    desc: |
      The duration of the interaction in seconds. Basically how long to hold the water pressed down.
