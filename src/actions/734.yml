type: 734
name: ParticleWindAcceleration
desc: |
  Controls how effective the wind is at accelerating the particles emitted from the node.

  Acceleration requires slot 10 to have an action that enables acceleration of the particles.
properties:
  acceleration:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      The acceleration in the direction of the wind.
  accelerationMultiplier:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      A multiplier for {@link acceleration the acceleration in the direction of the wind}.
  enabled:
    field: bool
    default: true
    desc: |
      Controls whether the wind should have any effect at all or not.
  unk_sdt_f1_1:
    field: int
    desc: |
      Unknown. 0 and 1 seems to be valid values, while all other values cause the wind to not affect the particles.
