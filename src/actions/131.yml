name: ParticleModifier
slot: ParticleModifier
meta:
  isAppearance: false
  isParticle: false
desc: |
  Modifies particles in various ways.

  Note: This is **not** a {@link Modifier property modifier}, it is an action that modifies particles emitted from the same node.
properties:
  speed:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: EffectAge
    scale: true
    time: true
    desc: |
      Controls the speed of the particles emitted from this node, but only if the effect has an action in the {@link ActionSlots.ParticleMovementAction ParticleMovement slot} that enables acceleration of particles. The direction is the particle's {@link InitialDirection initial direction}.
  scaleX:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      Multiplier for the scale along the X-axis for the particles emitted from this node.

      If {@link uniformScale} is enabled, this also affects the Y and Z axes.
  scaleY:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      Multiplier for the scale along the Y-axis for the particles emitted from this node.

      If {@link uniformScale} is enabled, {@link scaleX} also affects the Y-axis, and this property is ignored.
  scaleZ:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      Multiplier for the scale along the Z-axis for the particles emitted from this node.

      If {@link uniformScale} is enabled, {@link scaleX} also affects the Z-axis, and this property is ignored.
  color:
    type: Vector4Value
    components: 4
    default: [1, 1, 1, 1]
    argument: EffectAge
    color: true
    desc: |
      Color multiplier for the particles emitted from this node.

      Values in this are unrestricted and can go above 1.
  uniformScale:
    field: bool
    default: false
    desc: |
      Scales the particles emitted from this node uniformly based on {@link scaleX}. The other scale properties in this action have no effect when this is enabled.
