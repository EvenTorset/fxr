type: 501
name: CircularParticleSpread
slot: ParticleDirection
desc: |
  Gives each particle a random initial direction offset within a circular cone. See {@link InitialDirection} for more information.
properties:
  unk_er_f1_0:
    field: bool
    default: false
    desc: |
      No so much unknown, just unnamed. If enabled, this limits the possible directions to only positive values on one axis, effectively cutting the cone of possible directions in half.
  angle:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 30
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      The maximum change in direction in degrees, the angle of the cone.
  distribution:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 0
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      Controls the distribution of the random directions that can be chosen.
      - At 0, all directions within the cone have an equal chance of being chosen.
      - At 1, the default direction is guaranteed to be chosen.
      - At -1, the maximum change in direction is guaranteed, meaning the chosen direction will always be a fixed number of degrees away from the default direction based on {@link angle}.
      - Values between these values smoothly blend between them.
      - Values outside of the -1 to 1 range also work, but may do some unexpected things.
