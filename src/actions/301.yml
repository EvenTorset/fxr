  Emits particles once it has moved a certain distance from where it last emitted particles.
properties:
  threshold:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 0.1
    argument: ActiveTime
    scale: true
    desc: |
      How much the emitter must move to trigger emission.
  totalEmissions:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: -1
    argument: ActiveTime
    desc: |
      The total number of emissions. Once this limit is reached, the branch will be *removed from the effect*. The node and all of its descendants will be destroyed, and there are no ways to re-enable them without respawning the entire effect as they no longer exist.

      Can be set to `-1` to disable the limit.
  maxConcurrent:
    type: ScalarValue
    field: int
    default: -1
    argument: ActiveTime
    desc: |
      Maximum number of concurrent emitted particles or nodes. Can be set to `-1` to disable the limit.
