type: 60
name: ParticleSpeed
slot: ParticleMovement
desc: |
  Controls the movement of particles. This is the most basic action for controlling the speed of particles.
properties:
  gravity:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    scale: true
    time: sq
    desc: |
      Controls the acceleration of the particle along the global Y-axis. Positive values will make the particles go down, and negative values will go up.

      Unless it's left at 0, this changes the current direction of the particles, which can affect various other things, for example the rotation of {@link ActionType.Line Line} and {@link ActionType.QuadLine QuadLine} particles, and the direction of this action's {@link speed}. It does not affect the particles' {@link InitialDirection initial direction}.
  speed:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    scale: true
    time: true
    desc: |
      The particles' speed in their current direction, which is usually their {@link InitialDirection initial direction}, but can be changed over time by other things, for example this action's {@link gravity}.
  speedMultiplier:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: ParticleAge
    desc: |
      Multiplier for {@link speed}.
