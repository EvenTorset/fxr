  Controls the movement of particles. This extends {@link ActionType.ParticleSpeedRandomTurns ParticleSpeedRandomTurns} with the ability to make particles partially follow the parent node.
properties:
  gravity:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    scale: true
    time: sq
    desc: |
      Controls the acceleration of the particle along the global Y-axis. Positive values will make the particles go down, and negative values will go up.

      Unless it's left at 0, this changes the current direction of the particles, which can affect various other things, for example the rotation of {@link ActionType.Line Line} and {@link ActionType.QuadLine QuadLine} particles, and the direction of this action's {@link speed}. It does not affect the particles' {@link InitialDirection initial direction}.
  speed:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    scale: true
    time: true
    desc: |
      The particles' speed in their current direction, which is usually their {@link InitialDirection initial direction}, but can be changed over time by other things, for example this action's {@link gravity}.
  speedMultiplier:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: ParticleAge
    desc: |
      Multiplier for {@link speed}.
  maxTurnAngle:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    desc: |
      The particles will turn a random amount based on this value at intervals defined by {@link turnInterval}.

      This turning affects the particles' current direction, which can affect various other things, for example this action's {@link speed}.
  followFactor:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    desc: |
      Controls how well the particles should follow the parent node if they are not attached. At 0, the particles will not follow at all. At 1, the particles will follow perfectly, as if attached to the parent node. Negative values will make the particles move in the opposite direction compared to the parent node. Values greater than 1 will make the particles exaggerate the parent node's movement.

    field: float
  turnInterval:
    field: int
    lib: float
    time: inv
    desc: |
      The particles will turn a random amount based on {@link maxTurnAngle} at this interval. The units are seconds, but due to how the field that stores this value works, the value will be rounded to the nearest 0.02 seconds.

      This turning affects the particles' current direction, which can affect various other things, for example this action's {@link speed}.
  followRotation:
    field: bool
    default: true
    desc: |
      Disabling this will make {@link followFactor} only affect translation and not rotation.
