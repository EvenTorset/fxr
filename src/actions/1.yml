  Controls the movement of the node. This is the most basic action for controlling the acceleration of nodes.
properties:
  speedZ:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: Constant0
    scale: true
    time: true
    desc: |
      Controls the speed of the node along its Z-axis.
  accelerationZ:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ActiveTime
    scale: true
    time: sq
    desc: |
      Controls the acceleration of the node along its Z-axis. This value cannot be negative.
  accelerationMultiplierZ:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: ActiveTime
    desc: |
      Multiplier for {@link accelerationZ}.
  accelerationY:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ActiveTime
    scale: true
    time: sq
    desc: |
      Controls the acceleration of the node along its Y-axis.

      When set to 1, this makes the node align with the direction it's moving. Setting it to higher values seems to do the same as setting it to 0, which means it's probably not a boolean, but what those values do exactly is unknown.
