  Translates the node using a property, meaning it can be animated. This can be useful if you need the node to follow a specific path.
properties:
  translation:
    type: Vector3Value
    components: 3
    default: [0, 0, 0]
    argument: ActiveTime
    scale: true
    desc: |
      An offset for the position of the node.
  alignWithMotion:
    field: int
    desc: |
      When set to 1, this makes the node align with the direction it's moving. There are cases of this being set to 2 in vanilla, and it seems to behave similarly to when it is set to 0, so this is not a boolean. The actual differences between 0 and 2 are unknown.
