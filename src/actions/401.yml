type: 401
name: DiskEmitterShape
desc: |
  Makes the emitter disk-shaped.
properties:
  direction:
    type: InitialDirection
    field: int
    default: InitialDirection.Emitter
    desc: |
      Controls the initial direction for particles. See {@link InitialDirection} for more information.
  radius:
    type: ScalarPropertyArg
    default: 1
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      Radius of the disk.
  distribution:
    type: ScalarPropertyArg
    default: 0
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      Controls how the random emission points are distributed within the disk.
      - At 0, particles are equally likely to emit from anywhere inside the disk.
      - At 1, particles have a 100% chance of being emitted from the center point.
      - At -1, particles have a 100% chance of being emitted from the perimeter circle of the disk.
      - Values between these smoothly blend between them.
