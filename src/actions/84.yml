  Controls the movement of particles. This extends {@link ActionType.ParticleAcceleration ParticleAcceleration} with the ability to make particles make random turns at a fixed interval.
properties:
  gravity:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    scale: true
    time: sq
    desc: |
      Controls the acceleration of the particle along the global Y-axis. Positive values will make the particles go down, and negative values will go up.

      Unless it's left at 0, this changes the current direction of the particles, which can affect various other things, for example the rotation of {@link ActionType.Line Line} and {@link ActionType.QuadLine QuadLine} particles, and the direction of this action's {@link acceleration}. It does not affect the particles' {@link InitialDirection initial direction}.
  acceleration:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    scale: true
    time: sq
    desc: |
      The particles' acceleration in their current direction, which is usually their {@link InitialDirection initial direction}, but can be changed over time by other things, for example this action's {@link gravity}.
  accelerationMultiplier:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: ParticleAge
    desc: |
      Multiplier for {@link acceleration}.
  maxTurnAngle:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ParticleAge
    desc: |
      The particles will turn a random amount based on this value at intervals defined by {@link turnInterval}.

      This turning affects the particles' current direction, which can affect various other things, for example this action's {@link acceleration}.
  unk_ds3_f1_0:
    field: float
  turnInterval:
    field: int
    time: inv
    desc: |
      The particles will turn a random amount based on {@link maxTurnAngle} at this interval. The units are seconds, but due to how the field that stores this value works, the value will be rounded to the nearest 0.02 seconds.

      This turning affects the particles' current direction, which can affect various other things, for example this action's {@link acceleration}.
