  Gives each emitted instance a random initial direction offset within a rectangular cone. See {@link InitialDirection} for more information.
properties:
  angleX:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 30
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      The maximum change in direction in degrees, one of the angles of the elliptical cone.

      - angleY
  angleY:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 30
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      The maximum change in direction in degrees, one of the angles of the elliptical cone.

  distribution:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 0
    argument: EffectAge
    desc: |
      Controls the distribution of the random directions that can be chosen.
      - At 0, all directions within the cone have an equal chance of being chosen.
      - At 1, the default direction is guaranteed to be chosen.
      - At -1, the maximum change in direction is guaranteed, meaning the chosen direction will always be a fixed number of degrees away from the default direction based on {@link angleX} and {@link angleY}.
      - Values between these values smoothly blend between them.
      - Values outside of the -1 to 1 range also work, but may do some unexpected things.
