  Controls the movement of the node. This extends {@link ActionType.NodeSpeed NodeSpeed} with the ability to make the node turn a random amount at a given interval.
properties:
  speedZ:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: Constant0
    scale: true
    time: true
    desc: |
      Controls the speed of the node along its Z-axis.
  speedMultiplierZ:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: ActiveTime
    desc: |
      Multiplier for {@link speedZ}.
  accelerationY:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ActiveTime
    scale: true
    time: sq
    desc: |
      Controls the acceleration of the node along its Y-axis.
  maxTurnAngle:
    type: ScalarValue
    argument: ActiveTime
    desc: |
      The node will turn a random amount based on this value at intervals defined by {@link turnInterval}.
  alignWithMotion:
    field: int
    desc: |
      When set to 1, this makes the node align with the direction it's moving. Setting it to higher values seems to do the same as setting it to 0, which means it's probably not a boolean, but what those values do exactly is unknown.
  unk_ds3_f1_1:
    field: int
  turnInterval:
    field: int
    lib: float
    time: inv
    desc: |
      The node will turn a random amount based on {@link maxTurnAngle} at this interval. The units are seconds, but due to how the field that stores this value works, the value will be rounded to the nearest 0.02 seconds.
