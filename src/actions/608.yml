type: 608
name: RadialBlur
slot: Appearance
desc: |
  A particle that applies a radial blur to anything seen through it.

  Note: This particle is not visible if the "Effects" setting is set to "Low".
properties:
  uniformScale:
    field: bool
    default: false
    desc: |
      If enabled, the particle width-related properties and fields will control both the width and height of the particles, and the height counterparts will be ignored.
    see:
      - width
      - height
  iterations:
    field: int
    default: 1
    desc: |
      Controls how many times to apply the effect. Higher values can have a significant impact on performance.
  bloomRed:
    field: float
    default: 1
    desc: |
      Controls the redness of the color of the additional bloom effect. The colors of the particle will be multiplied with this color to get the final color of the bloom effect.

      Note:
      - This has no effect if the "Effects Quality" setting is set to "Low".
      - This does not affect the natural bloom effect from high color values.
    see:
      - bloomGreen
      - bloomBlue
      - bloomStrength
  bloomGreen:
    field: float
    default: 1
    desc: |
      Controls the greenness of the color of the additional bloom effect. The colors of the particle will be multiplied with this color to get the final color of the bloom effect.

      Note:
      - This has no effect if the "Effects Quality" setting is set to "Low".
      - This does not affect the natural bloom effect from high color values.

  bloomBlue:
    field: float
    default: 1
    desc: |
      Controls the blueness of the color of the additional bloom effect. The colors of the particle will be multiplied with this color to get the final color of the bloom effect.

      Note:
      - This has no effect if the "Effects Quality" setting is set to "Low".
      - This does not affect the natural bloom effect from high color values.

  bloomStrength:
    field: float
    desc: |
      Controls the strength of the additional bloom effect.

      Note:
      - This has no effect if the "Effects Quality" setting is set to "Low".
      - This does not affect the natural bloom effect from high color values.

  width:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1

      The width of the particle.

      If {@link uniformScale} is enabled, this also controls the height.

      Controls the amount of blur to apply. Values greater than 1 may appear glitchy.

      Minimum view distance. If a particle is closer than this distance from the camera, it will be hidden. Can be set to -1 to disable the limit.

      This requires {@link minFadeDistance} to be set to something other than -1.

      This is different from {@link minDistanceThreshold}, as this controls the start of a distance range that has smooth transitions at each end, while the threshold value is a hard cut-off.

  minFadeDistance:
    field: float
    default: -1
    scale: ifNotMinusOne
    desc: |
      This controls a point where the opacity of a particle will start to fade to 0 near the {@link minDistance minimum view distance}. At {@link minDistance}, the opacity will be 0, and it will linearly approach 1 as the distance between the camera and the particle approaches this distance.

      This requires {@link minDistance} to be set to something other than -1. This distance limit can be disabled by setting this and minDistance to -1.

      Parts of the particle with less opacity than this threshold will be invisible. The range is 0-255.

      This threshold creates a hard cut-off between visible and not visible, which is unlike the alpha *fade* threshold properties in some similar actions.
