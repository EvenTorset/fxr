  Emits particles periodically.
properties:
  interval:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: ActiveTime
    time: inv
    desc: |
      Time between emitting new particles in seconds.
  perEmission:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: 1
    argument: ActiveTime
    desc: |
      The number of particles or nodes to emit per emission.
  totalEmissions:
    type: ScalarValue
    default: -1
    argument: ActiveTime
    desc: |
      The total number of emissions. Once this limit is reached, the branch will be *removed from the effect*. The node and all of its descendants will be destroyed, and there are no ways to re-enable them without respawning the entire effect as they no longer exist.

      Can be set to `-1` to disable the limit.
  maxConcurrent:
    type: ScalarValue
    field: int
    default: -1
    argument: ActiveTime
    desc: |
      Maximum number of concurrent emitted particles or nodes. Can be set to `-1` to disable the limit.
