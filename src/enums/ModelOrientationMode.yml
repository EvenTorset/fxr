name: ModelOrientationMode
desc: |
  Values representing different orientation modes for {@link ActionType.Model Model} particles.
members:
  North:
    value: 0
    desc: |
      Faces global north.
  CameraPlane:
    value: 1
    desc: |
      Faces away from the camera plane, the same direction as the camera itself.
  ParticleDirection:
    value: 2
    desc: |
      Faces in the direction the particle is moving. This direction can be modified by {@link ActionSlots.DirectionSpreadAction DirectionSpread actions}, and is initially the particle's {@link InitialDirection}.
  GlobalPitch:
    value: 3
    desc: |
      Tries to face the camera, but is limited to rotation around the global X-axis.

      Seemingly identical to {@link UnkGlobalPitch}?
  GlobalYaw:
    value: 4
    desc: |
      Tries to face the camera, but is limited to rotation around the vertical global Y-axis.
  UnkGlobalPitch:
    value: 5
    desc: |
      Tries to face the camera, but is limited to rotation around the global X-axis.

      Seemingly identical to {@link GlobalPitch}?
