name: LightingMode
desc: |
  Values representing different lighting modes.

  These values and the fields they are used in require more testing. It's best to not assume they will work exactly as described. Values not covered by this enum are also used in vanilla effects, so there are a lot of unknown things about this.

    desc: |
      Same as {@link Lit}, but this seems to sometimes have an extra light source from somewhere?
  Unlit:
    value: -1
    desc: |
      Lighting does not affect the particles. No shadows or specular hightlights.
  Lit:
    value: 0
    desc: |
      Lighting affects the particles just like most regular objects.
