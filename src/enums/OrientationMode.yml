  Values representing different orientation modes for most particles.
members:
  South:
    value: 0
    desc: |
      Faces global south.

      See also:
      - {@link UnkSouth}
  CameraPlane:
    value: 1
    desc: |
      Faces the camera plane.

      See also:
      - {@link Camera}
  LocalSouth:
    value: 2
    desc: |
      Faces the -Z direction of the parent node.
  UnkSouth:
    value: 3
    desc: |
      Faces global south.

      Similar to {@link South}, but this seems to change the projection of the particle in some way.
  GlobalYaw:
    value: 4
    desc: |
      Tries to face the camera, but is limited to rotation around the vertical global Y-axis.
  East:
    value: 5
    desc: |
      Faces global east.
  Camera:
    value: 6
    desc: |
      Faces the camera.

      This is different from {@link CameraPlane}, as this makes it face the camera's position instead of the camera plane.
  LocalYaw:
    value: 7
    desc: |
      Tries to face the camera, but is limited to rotation around the Y-axis of the parent node.
  Unk11:
    value: 11
    desc: |
      Not yet tested. Found in 639742 in Elden Ring. This also implies the existence of 8, 9, and 10, but they have not been tested or found yet.
