    value: 0

      Distorts the background as if you stuck something into it and stirred it. It is animated, and the stir speed is controlled by a property.
  NormalMap:
    value: 1
    desc: |
      Distorts the background based on the normal map.
  Twist:
    value: 2
    desc: |
      Distorts the background as if the edges were held in place and you grabbed the center and twisted it.

      Seemingly identical to {@link NormalMap}?
  Unk4:
    value: 4
    desc: |
