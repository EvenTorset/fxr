name: PropertyArgument
desc: |
  Arguments used when evaluating properties.

  There is no way to change what argument is given to a property. Each property has one specific argument given to it, and this is sometimes the only difference between two properties in the same action.
members:
  Constant0:
    value: 0
    desc: |
      A constant value of 0.
  ParticleAge:
    value: 1
    desc: |
      Time in seconds since the particle was emitted.
  ActiveTime:
    value: 2
    desc: |
      Time in seconds since the action became active.

      An action becoming active is for example the delay from {@link ActionType.NodeAttributes NodeAttributes} being over, or the active {@link State} changing, making a node change which of its configs is active.
  EmissionTime:
    value: 3
    desc: |
      Time in seconds between the effect being created and the particle being emitted. Stays constant per particle.
  ExternalValue:
    value: 4
    desc: |
      An external value.
      
      In property modifiers, which external value is used is controlled by a field in the modifier.
