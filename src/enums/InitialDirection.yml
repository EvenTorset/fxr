name: InitialDirection
desc: |
  An emitted instance's initial direction is used for various things that require a direction, but does not have a set one to follow.
  - {@link ActionType.ParticleModifier ParticleModifier action}'s {@link ParticleModifier.speed speed}.
  - {@link ActionType.Line Line action}'s initial rotation.
  - {@link ActionType.QuadLine QuadLine action}'s initial rotation.

  The initial direction can be further modified by the following actions:
  - {@link ActionType.NoSpread NoSpread}
  - {@link ActionType.CircularSpread CircularDirectionSpread}
  - {@link ActionType.EllipticalSpread EllipticalDirectionSpread}
  - {@link ActionType.RectangularSpread RectangularDirectionSpread}

      The direction will depend on the emitter shape.
      | Emitter&nbsp;Shape | Direction |
      |:-|:-|
      | {@link ActionType.PointEmitterShape Point} | Same as {@link LocalNorth}. |
      | {@link ActionType.DiskEmitterShape Disk} | Same as {@link LocalNorth}. |
      | {@link ActionType.RectangleEmitterShape Rectangle} | Same as {@link LocalNorth}. |
      | {@link ActionType.SphereEmitterShape Sphere} | The direction cannot be changed for this emitter shape. |
      | {@link ActionType.BoxEmitterShape Box} | If {@link BoxEmitterShape.emitInside emitInside} is true, it picks a direction parallel to a random local axis. If it is false, the direction will be out from the box, perpendicular to the side where the particle was emitted. |
      | {@link ActionType.CylinderEmitterShape Cylinder} | Out from the cylinder's axis. |
