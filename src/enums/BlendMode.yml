  Unk0:
    value: 0

      Seemingly identical to {@link Add}?
  Source:
    value: 1
    desc: |
      Completely ignores blending. The source layer (particle) will be drawn in place of the background, ignoring the alpha of the layer.
  Normal:
    value: 2
    desc: |
      The source layer (particle) will be drawn on over the background. Transparent or partially transparent parts of the layer will allow the background to be seen through the layer.

      Also known as "source-over", and is the same as the "normal" blend mode found in many image editors.
  Multiply:
    value: 3
    desc: |
      The source layer (particle) will be multiplied with the background, ignoring the alpha of the layer.

      Same as the "multiply" blend mode found in many image editors.
  Add:
    value: 4
    desc: |
      The source layer (particle) multiplied by its alpha (clamped to [0, 1]) will be added to the background.

      Same as the "add", "additive", or "linear dodge" blend modes found in many image editors. The opposite of {@link Subtract}.
  Subtract:
    value: 5
    desc: |
      The source layer (particle) multiplied by its alpha (clamped to [0, 1]) will be subtracted from the background.

      Same as the "subtract" or "difference" blend modes found in many image editors. The opposite of {@link Add}.
  Unk6:

      Seemingly identical to {@link Normal}?
  Unk7:
    value: 7
