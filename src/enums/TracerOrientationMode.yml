name: TracerOrientationMode
desc: |
  Values representing different orientation modes for {@link ActionType.Tracer Tracer} and {@link ActionType.DynamicTracer DynamicTracer} particles.
members:
  Travel:
    value: 0
    desc: |
      The tracer source is perpendicular to the direction it's travelling and the direction of the camera.
  LocalZ:
    value: 1
    desc: |
      The tracer source is aligned with the local Z-axis, which is detenmined by the rotation of the node that emits the tracer.
  Vertical:
    value: 2
    desc: |
      The tracer source is aligned with the global vertical axis.
  GlobalX:
    value: 3
    desc: |
      The tracer source is aligned with the global X-axis.
  Cross:
    value: 4
    desc: |
      Creates two sources for the tracer with different orientation modes. One has {@link Vertical} and the other has {@link GlobalX}, forming a cross.
  Diagonal:
    value: 5
    desc: |
      The tracer source is parallel to the global diagonal (1, 1, 1).
